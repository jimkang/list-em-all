  name: "@godtributes"
  description: >
    <p>A bot that posts tributes to befitting each god! It reads (and watches) its followers' tweets for inspiration. This is my most popular bot.</p>
    <p>@godtributes is a few Node processes. One maintains a database of what it has replied with and to whom and when it did it. Another is a proxy cache to the Wordnik API. Another generates the standalone tribute tweets. Yet another listens to a Twitter stream in real time and generates (or doesn't) tributes based on incoming tweets' text and images.</p>

  name: Bot in the Street
  description: >
    <p>This bot comes up with different ways to fill out the "___ in the street but a ___ in the sheets" snowclone (originating from "a lady in the street but a freak in the sheets").</p>
    <p>It picks a random word, then pairs that word with an antonym, rhyme, or cross-reference from the Wordnik API. It seems like that may be too crude to work, but it turns out that the human mind tries pretty hard to connect the dots when it comes to many things, including innuendo.</p>
