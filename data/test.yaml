    <p>A bot that posts tributes to befitting each god! It reads (and watches) its followers' tweets for inspiration. This is my most popular bot.</p>
    <p>@godtributes is a few Node processes. One maintains a database of what it has replied with and to whom and when it did it. Another is a proxy cache to the Wordnik API. Another generates the standalone tribute tweets. Yet another listens to a Twitter stream in real time and generates (or doesn't) tributes based on incoming tweets' text and images.</p>
